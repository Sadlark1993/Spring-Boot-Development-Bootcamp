//API: mediator between a consumer and a system.
//REST API: API that conforms to a set of guidelines.

/* REST Guidelines
* Resource: piece of data that you can name;
* URI: identifies the location of the resource;
* defines operations that can manipulate resources:
  - GET: retrieves a resource;
  - POST: creates a resource;
  - PUT: updates a resource;
  - DELETE: deletes a resource.
* collection: grouping of resources;

//explained @ConditionalOnProperty.
//@ResponseBody serializes a response into Json.

//@RestController == @Controller + @ResponseBody

/*@RequestParam vs. @PathVariable
  In the past, we used @RequestParam to extract query values:

  // localhost:8080/hi?name=Harry 
  
  @GetMapping("/hi")
  public void handlerMethod(@RequestParam String name)


  We recently used@PathVariable to extract data from the URI.

  // localhost:8080/hi/Harry
  
  @GetMapping("/hi/{name}")
  public void handlerMethod(@PathVariable String name)


  @PathVariable is more suitable for REST

//@RequestBody Class object deserializes the Json into a Java object.
