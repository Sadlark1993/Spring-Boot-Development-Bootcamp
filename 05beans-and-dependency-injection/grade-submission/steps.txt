/* Bean
* a bean is an object that Spring stores and manages for you;
* to create a bean, you just need to make a @Component class;
* Spring creates an object out of each @Component class that it finds;
* a Spring container, also called ApplicationContext, stores and manages the object for you;
* the object lives inside of the spring container;
* an object that lives inside of the spring container is called bean;

*/

/* Dependency Injection
* never ever create an object inside of a classe that depends on it. This is called tight coupling and it makes unit tests impossible;
* instead, we should inject the object into the class;
* we use dependency injection to achieve loose coupling;

public class GradeController {

// a dependency is an object that another class depends on
// tight coupling makes unit test impossible

/* Dependency Injection Process
* annotate the class of the object with @Component;
* Spring-Boot registers the @Component class as a Bean;
* when the application runs, the Spring-Boot performs a Component scan, creates objects out of the Component class, stores it in the 
Spring Container;
* @Autowired injects the Bean into the dependent class;

//@Controller, @Service and @Repository are just like @Component. Use them at Controller, Service and Repository classes.
//any of this annotations will register the class as a Bean.

//A @Bean is an annotated method that returns a dependency:

@Bean
public GradeSubmissionRepository gradeRepository(){
  return new GradeSubmissionRepository();
}

// @Configuration marks the class as a source for @Bean definitions.
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {
  //...
  @Bean
  public GradeRepository gradeRepository(){
    return new GradeRepository();
  }
}

//@Autowired wires the @Bean to the class that needs it:
@Controller
public class GradeController {
  @Autowired
  GradeService gradeService
}

//in the workbook, there is an lesson where you config a bean using XML. I didn't do it, but if I need to know it, I'll come back here later.
